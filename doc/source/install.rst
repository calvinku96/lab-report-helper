Installation
============

To install you will need Python 2.7, it is not compatible yet with Python 3.x,
but it can be made compatible.

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- importlib
- hickle (optional, can be used instead of pickle)

You can directly use pip to install and take care of the dependencies

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip install labreporthelper
